## Jira Comment Linker - README
Overview
The Jira Comment Linker is a VS Code extension that makes JIRA task keys (e.g., PROJ-123) in your code clickable. When clicked, these keys open the corresponding JIRA task in your browser. Additionally, hovering over a task key provides useful details about the task, such as its status, assigned developer, QA, and completion date.


## Configurations
To use the extension, you need to configure your JIRA credentials and fields in your VS Code settings.

- Open Settings `(Ctrl + , or Cmd + ,)`.
- Search for jiraCommentLinker and configure the following settings:

`jiraCommentLinker.jiraBaseURL`: Base URL of your JIRA instance (e.g., https://yourcompany.atlassian.net).

`jiraCommentLinker.jiraToken`: Base64-encoded API token for JIRA.
Format: email:api_token (encoded in Base64).

`jiraCommentLinker.jiraFields`:
`developer`: Field key for the assigned developer.
`qa`: Field key for the QA.
`completeDate`: Field key for the task's completion date.

Example configuration in `settings.json`:
```json
{   
  "jiraCommentLinker.jiraBaseURL": "https://yourcompany.atlassian.net",
  "jiraCommentLinker.jiraToken": "dXNlcm5hbWU6YXBpX3Rva2Vu",
  "jiraCommentLinker.jiraFields": {
